# go-server
This a very basic web server in go using its native libraries.
This server has:
- A Main file
- A Handlers file where we have two example handlers
- A Router file where we have routes configuration
- A Server file where you can see the initialization of the server and its config
- A Middlewares file where you can check two example middlewares. One for auth (fake) and another for logging.
